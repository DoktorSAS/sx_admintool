    Code Developed by DoktorSAS - Join in Sorex Discord To Report Any BUGS
    Version 1.4
    Description: This is a simple tool to manage lobby withoy any dependence, you can use it but u have to import the SQL file
                 in your database. There a few simple commands for admin and a few for users. I also made a spawnmanager able to
                 respawn player in his last position and if he joined for the frist time he get teleported to the HUB/Spawn. When
                 player die he  get automaticaly respawned to the hospital.
    How to use it?
    Only the owner can set rank from chat, thats mean to set owner rank you need to change sx_group on the Database
